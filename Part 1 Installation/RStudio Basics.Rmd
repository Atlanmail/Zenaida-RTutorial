#R User Interface

When opening RStudio for the first time, a window will appear on your screen like this figure

![The default interface](DefaultScreen.png)

Notice there are three boxes, the Console, Environment and Files.

##Console

The console is used to execute commands in R. Anything that can be ran in R can be ran here.

##Environment

The environment shows any active variables in the workspace. You can use commands in the console in order to add and modify the active variables in the session. These environmental variables can be saved in the workspace.

##File
These are files that are in the environment. They can hold useful files like scripts, csvs and more. You can put files into the current folder by clicking blank file, then adding those files.
Alternatively, you can drag an outside file inside of the current folder R is working in. Note that files inside the explorer are not automatically added to the workspace and you need to use a command to add them in such as

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("your/Current/Directory")
data <- read.csv("your file.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```



##R Scripts

R Scripts hold code that can be ran. Like code in the console, running code in an RScript modifies the active workspace by adding or modifying existing variables. 

Unlike other programming languages, RStudio allows us to run individual lines of code or sections of code instead of the entire program. By highlighting the section you want to run, then clicking run, RStudio will execute only the highlighted lines of code instead of the entire program.

##R Markdown

RMarkdown (.rmd) files are a special type of file that allows code to be ran in a visually appealing manner. Basically, RMarkdown files automatically generate readable HTML files from code chunks, making them useful for generating reports and presenting your data. This web page was generated from a RMarkdown for example.

An RMarkdown file consists of three parts:
  A YAML header, which is used to generate the title
  R code chunks, which is surrounded by ```
  Text annotated with Markdown
