```{r}
#Load in the dataset
library(readr)
Olympic_Athlete_Bio <- read_csv("Olympic_Athlete_Bio.csv")

Olympic_Athlete_Bio <- Olympic_Athlete_Bio %>% mutate_at(c('weight'), as.double)

```
Calculate the BMI
```{r}
Olympic_Athlete_Bio$BMI <- Olympic_Athlete_Bio$weight / (Olympic_Athlete_Bio$height/100)^2
```

Perform the ANOVA Test
Null Hypothesis: The mean BMI across the countries are the same
Alt Hypothesis: At least one mean BMI across the countries are different

```{r}
athlete_bio_aov <- aov(Olympic_Athlete_Bio$BMI~factor(Olympic_Athlete_Bio$country_noc)) 
summary(athlete_bio_aov)
```

Because we P value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. We accept that at least one mean BMI across the countries are different.
